📋 Help command: ✅ PASS
🗑️ Remove contact command: ❌ FAIL

⚠️ **WARNING**: remove_contact command not available!
This means repeater purging will not work properly.
Check your meshcore-cli installation and device connection.
```

```
!repeater test-purge
```

---

## Help

### `!repeater help`

Shows comprehensive help for all repeater commands.

**Usage:**
```
!repeater help
```

---

## Configuration

The repeater management system respects several configuration settings in `config.ini`:

- `auto_manage_contacts` - Controls automatic contact management
  - `device` - Device handles auto-addition, bot manages capacity
  - `bot` - Bot automatically adds companion contacts and manages capacity
  - `false` - Manual mode (use commands to manage contacts)

- Auto-purge threshold and limits are configured in the repeater manager

---

## Notes

1. **DM Only**: All repeater commands are DM-only for security reasons
2. **Rate Limiting**: Geolocation commands respect rate limits (2 seconds between requests)
3. **Database Tracking**: All actions are logged in the database with reasons
4. **Verification**: Purge operations verify successful removal
5. **Background Tasks**: Some operations (like background geocoding) run asynchronously
6. **Multi-Message Responses**: Some commands (like `locations`) may send multiple messages to stay within message size limits

---

## Common Use Cases

### Initial Setup
```
!repeater scan                    # Catalog existing repeaters
!repeater status                  # Check contact list capacity
```

### Regular Maintenance
```
!repeater status                  # Check capacity
!repeater manage                  # Auto-manage if needed
!repeater update-geo              # Fill in missing location data
```

### Emergency Cleanup
```
!repeater status                  # Check if at limit
!repeater purge-status            # Detailed status
!repeater auto-purge trigger      # Trigger auto-purge
```

### Bulk Operations
```
!repeater purge 30                # Remove old repeaters
!repeater update-geo 20           # Geocode 20 repeaters
!repeater geocode bulk 25         # Bulk geocode 25 contacts
```
